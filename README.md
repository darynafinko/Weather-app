Weather App with Dynamic Lottie Animations
A modern, responsive weather dashboard featuring Glassmorphism design, pastel color palettes, and real-time weather animations. This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch data and dynamically adjusts the UI based on the time of day and specific weather conditions.

✨ Key Features
Dynamic Backgrounds: The app automatically switches between three distinct pastel gradients:

Sunny Day: Soft Pink/Yellow gradient.

Cloudy Day: Grey-blueish pastel theme.

Nighttime: Darker blue pastel gradient triggered after sunset.

Lottie Animations: Replaces static icons with high-quality moving weather animations that adapt to day/night cycles (e.g., Moon for clear nights, Sun for clear days).

Glassmorphism UI: A sleek, semi-transparent "dark glass" card ensures all white text and icons remain readable on light backgrounds.

Detailed Weather Data: Provides temperature, humidity, wind speed, and accurate sunrise/sunset times.

Responsive Search: Includes an interactive search bar that darkens dynamically to maintain contrast with the background.

🛠️ Built With
HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and custom frosted-glass styling.
